To check if there is a listening or unknown device connected to your Windows system, you can follow these steps. 
This process involves using both Windows Task Manager and Command Prompt to identify listening ports and unfamiliar devices or connections.

### **1. Check for Listening Ports Using Command Prompt**

Listening ports indicate if your system is waiting for a connection (e.g., from another device or service). To identify which ports are open and what services/devices are using them:

#### Steps:
1. **Open Command Prompt**:
   - Press **Windows + R**, type `cmd`, and press **Enter**.

2. **Run the netstat Command**:
   - In the Command Prompt window, type the following command:
     ```
     netstat -ano
     ```
   - This will show a list of all active connections and listening ports, along with the **PID** (Process ID) of the associated application.

3. **Check for Listening Ports**:
   - Look for entries under the **State** column marked as **LISTENING**. These indicate services or devices listening for connections.
   - You will see local IP addresses and port numbers (e.g., `127.0.0.1:8080`).

4. **Identify the Process**:
   - Note the **PID** of the process associated with the listening port.
   - Open **Task Manager** (press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc**).
   - Go to the **Details** tab and match the **PID** with the corresponding process name to identify which application or service is using that port.

5. **Investigate Unknown Connections**:
   - If you see an unfamiliar application or device listening on a port, search for its name online to understand whether it is legitimate or possibly malicious.

#### Optional - Use netstat to Check for Foreign IP Addresses:
- If you suspect an unknown external device might be connected:
   ```
   netstat -an | find "ESTABLISHED"
   ```
   This will show active connections with foreign IP addresses.

### **4. Check for Running Processes Using Task Manager**

To further investigate unknown processes or devices:
1. **Open Task Manager**:
   - Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open Task Manager.

2. **Look at Background Processes**:
   - Go to the **Processes** tab and look under **Background Processes**.
   - If you see any unfamiliar or suspicious processes, right-click them and select **Open File Location** to investigate which program is associated with them.
   - You can also search for the process name online to see if it is known to be safe or malicious.

### **5. Use Third-Party Tools for More In-Depth Scanning**

You can use third-party tools to scan your system for unknown listening devices or active connections:
- **Wireshark**: A network monitoring tool that captures network traffic in real-time.
- **TCPView**: A free utility from Microsoft that shows detailed listings of all TCP and UDP endpoints on your system, including the local and remote addresses.
- **Process Explorer**: A more detailed version of Task Manager that can show exactly what processes are running and their associated ports.

---

### **Summary of Steps**:
- Use `netstat -ano` in Command Prompt to check for listening ports.
- Use **Task Manager** to identify unknown processes associated with those ports.
- Check **Device Manager** for any unknown devices.
- Use the `arp -a` command to check for unknown devices connected to your network.
- Optionally, use third-party tools like **Wireshark**, **TCPView**, or **Process Explorer** for deeper insights.
